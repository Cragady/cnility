K&R 2E is an amazing book both in terms of historical impact and the quality of its technical writing.
I had purchased both the first and the second edition of K&R and was looking to buy a good quality (typeset) 
pdf for reference electronically. Sadly, this does not exit. Yes, I know about the "digital edition".

My intent is to make a version that is reasonably close to the original layout.

Please support the original publisher and authors by buying a copy.

TODO
-------
* Complete Appendix A, B, and C
* Replicate original's header and TOC for memoir class
* Thorough layout error checking (maybe implementing 
* Digitization of Tondo's C Answer book.
* Open source the LaTeX (will after finished)
* Not get in trouble
